Here are some mistakes often made by Japanese learners:

1. Using “He play tennis” instead of “He **plays** tennis.”
2. Confusing “l” and “r” sounds.
3. Saying “I’m boring” when you mean “I’m **bored**.”

Be mindful of these differences and practice with a native speaker or tutor when possible!

You can improve with awareness and practice.
