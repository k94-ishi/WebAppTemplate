Learning English can feel overwhelming at first, but it doesn't have to be.

Start with the basics: set clear goals, focus on high-frequency vocabulary, and make a habit of daily practice. Apps like Duolingo or Anki can help you stay consistent.

Remember: the key is **consistency over perfection**.

Happy learning!
